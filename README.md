11t is an iOS and Android app for connecting to platforms built on [ActivityPub](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon), written in Flutter. At the moment, I'm focussing on Pixelfed.

I connect to Pixelfed on my private server [tuluk.nl](https://tuluk.nl/), and everyone can start her own server. 11t lets you use any instance.

## How do I pronounce 11t? ##

Easy -- it's `elephan-t`.
